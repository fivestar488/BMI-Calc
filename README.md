How It Works
The BMI is calculated using the formula:
BMI = (weight / (height²)) × 703

The app then categorizes your BMI into one of the following:

Underweight: BMI < 18.5

Normal weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9

Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 29.9

Obese: BMI ≥ 30

A progress bar visually represents your BMI on a scale, and its color changes based on your category.

Technologies Used
